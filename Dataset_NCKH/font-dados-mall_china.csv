Introduction
Current marketing and design practice assume Chinese consumers shopping
motivations match those of Western countries. Western fashion retailers are
"increasingly looking to capitalise upon China’s expanding market, predicted to be worth"
"over $320 billion by 2020 (Lam and Chan, 2016). The importance of retail's expansion"
"within China cannot be understated, with the United Nations (2016) stating that for"
"continued economic growth and stability, the fashion industry depends upon successful"
"growth in China. Given China’s increasing prominence, it is surprising that China's"
distinctive shopping motivations have yet to be profiled. This is despite the disparity
between Chinese and Wester behavioural motivations being well established (Arvidsson
"and Niessen, 2015; Rahman et al., 2018; Tsai and Men, 2017). Thus, the unique shopping"
motivations of Chinese fashion consumers are uncapitalised on.
0
The limited understanding of Chinese consumer preference and behaviour represents
another critical limitation in designing effective marketing strategies in China.
"Specifically, the profiles of motivation relative to retail channel preference and purchase"
"behaviours have yet to be given the critical insight they require (Bonetti et al., 2017)."
"While traditional marketing practices have seen some success, multichannel marketing's"
expansion across diverse retail channels in dissimilar economic conditions makes China
a more complex case than existing theory can support. The complexity is confounded by
"China’s recent economic slowdown, making understanding consumer motivations more"
"vital than ever (Bonetti et al., 2017). Since the experience of engaging in diverse retail"
channels alters the consumer’s motivations and spending behaviours (Bonnin and
"Goudey, 2012; Ottar Olsen and Skallerud, 2011), retailers must base strategic decisions"
upon empirical consumer profiles instead of assumed parity to Western markets. Failure
to understand such interconnections may lead to repeating the mistakes of earlier

"retailers    who      failed    in    the    Chinese     market       (Hopkins,    2015)."
This study focuses on China due to its increasing prominence in international fashion
retail and its representation of a developing nation. By understanding China’s unique
"consumer profiles, this paper establishes theory in the form of consumer description"
"whilst anticipating behaviours within other developing nations. Specifically, three"
research objectives are employed to investigate shopping motivations’ influence on
fashion retail engagement in China:
0
1. To understand how demographics associate with shopping motivations in China
to inform more effective marketing strategies.
2. To understand how the retail channel preference (e-Commerce or high street) is
influenced by shopping motivations in China to facilitate more effective retail
channel design.
3. To understand how spending on fashion apparel is influenced by shopping
motivations in China to identify salient motivators for efficient marketing
strategy development.
0
This study restricts consumer shopping motivations to hedonic and unitarian
dimensions. Hedonic and utilitarian shopping motivations provide a comprehensive
"depiction of variables that influence retail engagement (Childers et al., 2001; Parker and"
"Wang, 2016). Multiple analysis of variance tests (MANOVA) are applied to investigate"
demographics’ association with shopping motivations through. Direct logistic regression
is applied to examine the influence of shopping motivation on retail channel preference
and monthly expenditure. The statistical analysis offers an empirical understanding of
Chinese consumer perceptions for fashion retailers seeking to develop their brand in
"China. In particular, this paper makes the following contributions:"
0
"•   Demographics have limited association with shopping motivations in China, with"
Gender (women > men) and Age (18 - 35’s > 35 - 55) only achieving small effect
"sizes. This is besides Occupation, Income and Education having no significant"
association at all.
"•   E-Commerce shopping preference is significantly influenced by Adventure, Social"
and Idea shopping motivations in a model that predicts 65% of all cases.

•    High monthly spending on fashion apparel is significantly influenced by

Consumer Behaviour And Shopping Motivations
Crane (2000) defines fashion as the apparel choices people make relative to their
"desired social identity and the tasks the apparel must fulfil. Thus, fashion relates to the"
"consumer’s self-concept in a way that few other products can match (Chebat et al.,"
"2006; Parker and Doyle, 2018). Therefore, any attempt to describe motivation must"
focus on function and experience through which a person's 'self' can be realised. The
excellent work of Carpenter et al. (2005) and Childers et al. (2001) highlights how both
"function and experience are essential to motivate purchase behaviours. By definition,"
motivation is a concept difficult to describe due to its indirectly observable
"characteristics (Lapointe and Perreault, 2013). However, hedonic (multisensory, fantasy"
"or emotional focus; Hirschman and Holbrook, 1982) and utilitarian (functional focus;"
"Babin et al., 1994) dimensions are key motivators for fashion shopping; as described"
within Table 1.

Hedonic and utilitarian shopping motivations have been used with great success in
contemporary research to define behaviour in contexts such as consumer engagement
"(Jones et al., 2006; Ruzeviciute and Kamleitner, 2017), technology enhancement"
"(Blázquez, 2014), experience marketing (Tynan and McKechnie, 2009), sustainability"
"(Ozdamar Ertekin et al., 2015) and cultural influences (Giovannini et al., 2015; Kooti et"
"al., 2016). In each of these contexts hedonic and utilitarian motivation are established"
as powerful discriminating variables.

The Influence Of Demographics In Fashion Retail
0
Contemporary western research recommends differentiating consumers by shopping
"motivations and demographics to develop targeted marketing strategies (Kalia, 2017;"
"Kotzé et al., 2012). Such categorisation in China would allow for an increased targeting"
"of consumer groups identified as having high shopping motivations. However, the"
"degree to which this relates to China, or how demographics associated with Chinese"
shopping motivations are undefined.
0
Gender has a long-standing association with Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce)
"behaviour. In the USA, male and female college students show significant differences in"
"shopping orientations, information searches and purchase experiences (Seock and"
"Bailey, 2008). Such differences have a neurological basis, with women associating with"
"greater levels of engagement and trust (Riedl et al., 2010), as well as Hedonic shopping"
"activities (Huang and Yang, 2010; Kalia, 2017; Kotzé et al., 2012). Earlier research by"
Chen (2007) and Shaouf et al. (2016) found that men prefer e-Commerce channels more
"than women, who show a greater preference for high street retail. However, these"
conclusions focus on western consumers and therefore the generalisability to the
"Chinese market is untested. Thus, this study proposes Hypothesis 1a:"
0
•   H1a: Women express statistically greater levels of shopping motivation than
men in China by a medium effect size; partial eta2 of .3>.
0
"Age is another important theme in earlier research, with Rocha et al. (2005) showing"
that UK consumers of different genders and ages have alternative needs and
experiences for fashion apparel. Adolescents in Taiwan and India echo this by expressing
"greater e-Commerce shopping motivations than older consumers (Huang and Yang,"
"2010; Kalia, 2017). Previous research furthermore shows younger consumers to be more"
engaged in fashion shopping as an enjoyable activity than older consumers (Bridges and
"Florsheim, 2008; Parker and Wang, 2016). The differences in behaviour towards fashion"
consumption may be explained by younger consumers (under 34) having a greater
"desire for self-expression and realisation of self-image congruity 1(Chebat et al., 2006)."

"Additionally, consumers over 35 are more aware of effort and time needs than younger"
"consumers (Sharma et al., 2012). Conversely, Generation Y consumers (under 35) are"
"the greatest driver behind luxury fashion consumption (Jay, 2012). However, such"
empiracle research does not exist within Chinese contexts. This leaves the
generalizability of age's influence to the international audience unanswered. It is
therefore imperative to determine the degree to which age influences Chinese
"consumers’ purchase motivation. Thus, this study proposes Hypothesis 1b:"
0
•   H1b: Under 35s express greater levels of shopping motivation than over 35s in
China by a medium effect size; partial eta2 of .3>.
0
"Finally, education, income and occupation are traditionally important discriminating"
factors in marketing. This is because of their association with the consumer’s potential
"disposable income (Goworek and McGoldrick, 2015; McGoldrick, 2002). Despite such a"
"position being accepted within marketing theory, the academic literature has long been"
"divided on how salary (Al-Somali et al., 2009) education (Cheawkamolpat, 2018;"
"Mahmood et al., 2004) and occupation (Joo Park et al., 2006; Kalia, 2016) moderate"
"consumer behaviour and motivation. For example, Hernández et al. (2011) showed that"
socioeconomic variables including income did not influence e-Commerce perceptions
"and behaviours. In contrast, Pattanaik et al. (2017) revealed that social standing"
influences shopping behaviours. Given the limited research into demographics’
"association with Chinese shopping motivations, assumptions as to which demographic"
"variables to use as discriminating factors cannot be made with authority. Thus, this study"
proposes Hypothesis 1c-1d:
0
•   H1c: University Educated consumers express statistically greater levels of
shopping motivation than High School educated consumers in China by a
medium effect size; partial eta2 of .3>.
•   H1d: Consumers with an above average income (¥80k >) express statistically
greater levels of shopping motivation than average below (< ¥80k) within China
by a medium effect size; partial eta2 of .3>.

•   H1e: Full-time occupation associated with higher levels of shopping motivation

High Street And E-Commerce Retail Channel Preference
0
While an individual may experience the same basic motivations in life (e.g. shopping for
their family; or Role Shopping) the experience of engaging in different environments
"influences their motivations (Bonnin and Goudey, 2012; Ottar Olsen and Skallerud,"
2011). This is because hedonic shopping motivations depend on the way retailers deliver
"their services. Furthermore, experiential consumers may be more concerned with the"
"Hedonic enjoyment, fantasy and sensual experiences of shopping than the functional"
"acquisition of products (To et al., 2007). This advances the concept of high street retail"
having a higher ability to capitalise on consumer motivations than e-Commerce retail.
High street retails dominance in this factor stems from the sensual nature of the built
"environment not replicable in the digital domain (Warnaby, 2013; Warnaby and Parker,"
"2017). However, the degree to which Chinese consumers’ shopping motivation"
influences high street or e-Commerce preference is unknown.
0
Retail channels are physical or virtual locations where customers make a purchase. This
paper accepts a common nomenclature of physical retail channels as ‘bricks and mortar’
"stores catering for the economy, high street, diffusion or luxury market sectors (Jackson"
"and Shaw, 2009). While high street refers to a specific sector of fashion retail, this paper"
considers all physical retail environments as ‘high street’ because of their universal
ability to be visited and experienced across the widest range of human senses. E-
Commerce channels represent physical retail brands using the internet to facilitate sales
"(Zeng and Xu, 2010). Mobile Commerce (m-Commerce) is itself a subset of e-Commerce,"
"being the same facilitation of retail activities, but restricted to mobile devices such as"
smartphones and tablets. While the products in m-Commerce apps may be identical to
"that available via a website, m-Commerce focuses on smaller screens in mobile"
situations. This differing focus leads to alternative methods of information presentation
"and consumer engagement (Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2011). Designers in turn focus on"
"the different situations of the customer engagement with the device, often anticipating"
"different goals and motivations the customer will experience (Parker, 2018). Given the"

parallel development of apps within China because of western services being blocked
"by the Great Firewall of China 2, design standards and consumer experiences differ from"
the West. Such differences mean that inter-relations between technology and the
"consumer established in the West cannot be assumed within China. Thus, this study"
proposes Hypothesis 2.

Motivation’s Influence On Fashion Purchase Behaviour
0
Individual spending on fashion apparel in China is shown to be higher than in western
"countries, with a 10% annual market growth (Phillips, 2016; Statista, 2017). This is"
despite fashion apparel from international brands in China being around 120% their
"equal price in the USA (McCarthy et al., 2017). As market leaders including Amazon"
"demonstrate, understanding the unique shopping motivations of consumers has a"
"prodigious potential to inform marketing strategies that achieve dominance (Sender,"
2017). Without understanding the unique shopping motivations of Chinese consumers
"and their influence on fashion spending, powerful marketing strategies cannot be"
developed for China.
0
Self-reported expenditure on fashion items is a variable excluded by many models that
"stop at purchase intention (e.g. Kang and Kim, 2013; Tsai, 2005). In earlier research,"
Scarpi (2005) suggested that hedonic-orientated consumers spend more on non-
essential goods (e.g. fashion items) than utilitarian-orientated consumers. This relates
to how consumers with an active interest in being well-dressed have higher purchase
"intentions, albeit dependent upon additional environmental impacts (Jin Gam, 2011)."
"However, the connection between e-Commerce and consumer spending as influenced"
"by shopping motivation in China remains untested (McCormick et al., 2017). Thus, this"
study proposes Hypothesis 3.

This study targeted both men and women to investigate H1a (gender). To investigate
"H1b (age), participants were sampled from Chinese consumers aged 18 to 65. In"
"addressing H1c (education), both university (Undergraduate and Postgraduate) and high"
school (Mainstream and Senior) educated persons were sampled. H1d (income) was
satisfied through sampling respondents with annual incomes from < ¥30k to ¥300k >;
"respective of the Chinese average income of ¥68k per annum (Statista, 2018). Finally,"
"respondents were sampled from full-time, self-employed, unemployed and student"
occupations; addressing H1e (occupation). The sampling frame also required
respondents to have recent experience with m-Commerce fashion purchases (satisfying
H2; retail channel preference) and an active interest in fashion (satisfying H3; monthly
expenditure). Table 2 details descriptives of the sample.

Data Collection
This study sampled respondents through the Chinese marketing service SoJump
(wjx.cn). SoJump’s successful use in earlier consumer behaviour research testifies to the
"suitability of the platform (e.g. Chang et al., 2014; Lien et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018)."
Pre-registered respondents on the SoJump platform were administered the survey
instrument over a four-week period in February 2017. As this study's sample drew from
"a non-specific region within China, regional bias was reduced. The selection process also"
required a reasonable level of computer literacy of all respondents.

Development Of The Survey Instrument
0
A questionnaire was created in English and then professionally translated into
Mandarin. The questionnaire comprised 32 questions measuring the constructs of
"Hedonic and Utilitarian Shopping motivations, with two positive and two negative"
"statements per dependant variable. Before participation, the survey instructed"
respondents to visualise and consider their regular shopping experiences (either high
street or e-Commerce) to prep their thoughts relative to the shopping focus of the
research. Examples of the statements presented to respondents are shown in Table 3.
"The resulting scale items exhibited a minimum Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .85,"
"exceeding the preferred threshold of .8 for inter-item reliability (Devallis, 2012)."

20 Chinese Students at the University of Manchester (aged 18 - 23) took part in a pilot
"scheme during January 2017. In this pilot, all respondents had experience in e-"
"Commerce and high street retail channels, thus satisfying the sample’s experience"
"requirements (Churchill, 1979). This confirmed that all questions are understood and"
relevant to measuring their intended item.

Data Analysis
Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) tests investigated the association between
demographics and shopping motivations (H1a – H1e). MANOVA was selected since the
H1a to H1e consider the variation in the sample attributes. Analysis utilised MANOVA as
an alternative to multiple ANOVAs to reduce the probability of Type II errors resulting
from multiple comparisons; an occurrence probability of 34% 4.

Direct logistic regression investigated the influence of Shopping Motivations on retail

Preliminary Data Analysis
"Preliminary testing checked for normality, linearity, univariate and multivariate outliers,"
"homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices, and multicollinearity. Data was cleaned"
to ensure a minimum sample size of 20 respondents per cell to achieve suitable
"robustness within the tests (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001, p. 251). Cases with a critical"
Mahalanobis distance less than 26.13 were included within the study to ensure
"multivariate normality (Pearson and Hartley, 1958). No serious violations of"
assumptions were encountered.

Retail Channel Preference’s (H2) association with Monthly Spending on Fashion Items

Hedonic And Utilitarian Shopping Motivations
The sample expressed high levels of motivation to shop for fashion items. Paired-
samples t-tests were applied to all components of shopping motivation to investigate
inter-relational differences. All hedonic and utilitarian motivations exhibited statistically
"significant inter-item differences (𝑝𝑝 < .000), with an average eta squared (𝜂𝜂2 ) of.5;"

which shows a medium to large effect sizes. The sample showed high medians for
shopping motivation across all elements of the survey; see Figure 1. All areas of hedonic
and utilitarian motivation are shown to be important respondent shopping
engagements. However greater salience can be attributed to the utilitarian motivations.

"achieved a statistically significant difference; 𝐹𝐹(1, 391) = 9.06, 𝑝𝑝 = .003. In the data,"
under 35s reported a higher mean level of Achievement Shopping motivation

Retail Channel Preference (H2)
Direct logistic regression assessed shopping motivations's impact on the preference for
shopping through e-Commerce channels. The full model containing all predictors was
"statistically significant; 𝜒𝜒 2 (8, 𝑁𝑁 = 403) = 38.13, 𝑝𝑝 < .000 , showing that the model"
could distinguish between respondents who reported a preference for e-Commerce
shopping over high street shopping. The model explained between 9.0% (Cox and Snell
R square) and 12.1% (Nagelkerke R squared) of the variance in e-Commerce shopping
habits; classifying 64.8% of cases.

Hypothesis H2 is therefore accepted.

"As shown in Table 5, only three of the independent variables made a unique statistically"

Fashion Apparel Spending (H3)
Direct logistic regression investigated shopping motivation's impact on the likelihood
that respondents would spend ¥1k > per month. The full model containing all predictors
"was statistically significant; 𝜒𝜒 2 (8, 𝑁𝑁 = 403) = 38.94, 𝑝𝑝 < .000, showing that the model"
could distinguish between respondents who reported a preference for e-Commerce
shopping over high street shopping. The model explained between 9.2% (Cox and Snell
"R square) and 12.3% (Nagelkerke R squared) of the variance in e-Commerce preference,"
classifying 64.5% of cases.

motivation of gratification shopping influences respondents who spend ¥1k > per month
on fashion items were more than those who spent < ¥1k per month. The odds ratio of

Discussion

Demographics
"In marketing, demographics and shopping motivations are commonly utilised to develop"
"consumer groups. Yet, before this paper, scant knowledge exists as to the how different"
demographics associate with shopping motivations within Chinese Fashion retail.
0
"This study confirms Gender as an influential variable, with women associating with"
"Adventure, Gratification and Role shopping motivations to a higher degree than men."
"Thus Hypothesis 1a is accepted, agreeing with earlier research (Arnold and Reynolds,"
"2003; Huang and Yang, 2010; Kalia, 2017; Seock and Bailey, 2008). However, this"
contradicts earlier research where we would expect women to express higher levels of
"motivation across all hedonic and utilitarian dimensions (Kotzé et al., 2012). This"
unexpected disagreement may stem from China’s unique cultural identity to Western
nations where the research was conducted. The gender difference shown in this paper
also agrees with the previously shown lower shopping motivations of men (Gupta and
"Gentry, 2016). This outcome may stem from women being the main consumers in the"
"commercial market in Western and Chinese cultures (Alesina et al., 2013). However, this"
study focused on post-experience reflection and therefore could not include factors that
"increase gendered differences. Consequently, women's understanding of goods,"
services and related retail channels are deeper than those of men (Bakewell and
"Mitchell, 2003)."
0
"This paper shows age associates with shopping motivations, with respondents under 35"
"associating with higher levels of Achievement Shopping. Thus, Hypothesis 1b is"
"accepted. This outcome agrees with Kooti et al. (2016) and Giovannini et al. (2015), who"
"stated that lower age associates with higher purchase motivations. However, the results"
"of this paper only accepts one shopping motivation associating with Age, rather than all"
"motivations as previously positioned (Giovannini et al., 2015; Kooti et al., 2016; Rocha"
"et al., 2005). Consequently, the age of Chinese consumers can no longer be seen as a"
universally segregating variable relating to shopping motivations. Regarding Rocha et al.
"(2005), this may be because 22% of their participants were much younger than in this"
study; aged 15-19. Achievement shopping’s importance may be because of younger

consumers being more engaged in shopping as an enjoyable activity (Bridges and
"Florsheim, 2008; Parker and Wang, 2016). The fact this paper’s findings align with earlier"
"research from Western (Bagdoniene and Zemblyte, 2009; Sorce et al., 2005) and Asian"
"contexts (Teo, 2001; To et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2016) suggests an industry preference"
to see younger consumers as highly motivated consumers.
0
"Occupation, income and education level did not associate with variance in shopping"
motivations; rejecting Hypotheses 1c – 1e. This result contradicts the traditional
"marketing perspective that education, occupation and income influences purchase"
"behaviour (Goworek and McGoldrick, 2015; Kalia, 2017). Furthermore, the lack of"
demographic association with shopping motivation is contrary to the ‘Digital Divide’ in
"China driven by gender, education and income levels (Wu et al., 2011). Acknowledging"
"that consumers of low and high-income experience similar shopping motivations, a gulf"
exists between motivations to shop and the ability for consumers to make purchases.
"This paper hence settles the debate of education, occupation and income’s association"
with shopping motivation within China. Despite these demographics being prominent
"social discriminators, marketers should not assume they will lead to differences in"
Chinese consumer retail engagement by motivation.

Retail Channel Preference
Delivering seductive retail experiences has long been an essential element of visual
"fashion marketing (Parker and Doyle, 2018). Yet, how shopping motivations influence"
"retail channel preference in China has remained undefined, constraining the ability to"
capitalise upon each channel’s strengths.
0
"E-Commerce shopping preference in China is influenced by Adventure, Social and Idea"
shopping motivations in a model that predicts 65% of cases; accepting Hypothesis 2.
"Given the sensuality embodied within contemporary User Experience (UX) design, it is"
"surprising that the motivations of Gratification, Value and Efficiency loaded on high"
street preference instead of e-Commerce channels. This contradicts earlier research
that discounts available through e-Commerce environments offer better price value
than available on the high street. Such influence can be explained through the
multisensory nature of physical retail that cannot be replicated in a digital format

"(Bonnin and Goudey, 2012; Ottar Olsen and Skallerud, 2011). By this, the high street"
"experience satisfies the visceral and emotional needs of the consumer, enabling their"
"retail experiences to become entertainment. However, the influence of Adventure"
shopping on e-Commerce preference prohibits the conclusion that high street retail is
"the greatest proponent of satisfying consumer needs. Furthermore, the salience of Idea"
shopping motivations influencing e-Commerce preference agrees with earlier research
"underlining trend communication’s importance to mobile retail channels (Yang and Kim,"
2012).
0
Monthly Fashion Spend
Increasing consumer spending is the most essential element of fashion retail. Although
earlier research suggests hedonic shopping motivations are influential in retail
"expenditure, this study could not replicate this finding. Therefore, the degree to which"
"these variables are influential in China, and how shopping motivations influence"
behaviour must be questioned.
0
Monthly spending on fashion items of ¥1k or more is influenced by Gratification and
"Idea shopping. Conversely, monthly spending of less than ¥1k is influenced by Value"
shopping. Hypothesis 3 is therefore accepted. The influence of shopping motivations is
of great importance to the wider research community because of its general exclusion
"from models stopping at purchase intention (Kang and Kim, 2013; Tsai, 2005). Although"
"only Gratification and Idea shopping motivations influence high levels of spending, the"
"results support hedonic shopping motivations influence on fashion purchases (Scarpi,"
2005). The need to understand consumer spending influences has therefore been met
"(Davis, 2013; McCormick et al., 2017). However, these differentiating motivators are not"
"the most prevalent of all motivations measured in the study. Therefore, the power of"
shopping motivations’ influence must be tempered considering additional influencing
"factors. Focusing on Adventure, Gratification and Idea shopping motivations provides a"
"suitable opportunity to capture the impetus of key consumers. However, this should not"
"occur at the expense of utilitarian Efficiency, hedonic Achievement or the facilitation of"
Role shopping.

Conclusion
"In conclusion, this paper profiles the shopping motivations of Chinese consumers"
"relative to demographics, fashion item expenditure and retail channel preference."
Theory is established in the form of consumer description whilst anticipating behaviours
within other developing nations. The understanding of Chinese fashion consumers’
unique characteristics is enriched by providing empirical evidence of the key variable’s
influence.
0
A key finding of this paper is that shopping motivations have less impact on retail
"channel preference, monthly spending and associated with demographics than"
"suggested by earlier research. Only hedonic motivations were shown to be influential,"
with utilitarian shopping motivations having no significant influence on the dependent
variables. Utilitarian motivations therefore do not discriminate between retail channel
choice and consumer behaviours. In revealing the motivational characteristics
"associated with retail channel preference, this paper provides a framework for"
"marketers and designers to build upon in developing effective strategies. Thus, retail"
environments and e-Commerce channels can be designed to capitalise upon the unique
characteristics of Chinese consumers. This is one of the earliest endeavours to
empirically profile the influential characteristics of Chinese fashion consumers relative
"to shopping motivations, behaviour and preference."
0
Current research is underway to develop Virtual Reality shopping channels in China. As
a retail channel that has yet to reach a consensus on how experiences should be
"delivered to consumers (Xue et al., 2018), virtual reality can benefit from the insights of"
this paper. Marketers and designers can also expect the same influences to apply to
"their emerging user base. As a result, this paper provides a basis for understanding the"
shopping motivations marketers and designers require to engage Chinese consumers
across multiple fashion retail channels.

Managerial Implications
0
This study found Idea Shopping to have the highest influence on e-Commerce
"preference and is prominent in predicting consumer expenditure. Therefore, retailers"
must focus on creating innovative communicating trends methods through their

Chinese apps and services. Marketing campaigns should promote such trend
"communication features within their retail apps. Furthermore, retailers should integrate"
post-purchase Achievement sharing via social media. This shall capitalise upon Chinese
consumers under 35 years-old associating with higher levels of Achievement Shopping
and placing greater importance on Social Shopping through e-Commerce channels.
Integrating post-purchase sharing has the opportunity of capitalising on Electronic Word
"of Mouth (eWOM) a strong channel for innovation diffusion. Finally, the finding that"
Gratification shopping is the most prominent predictor of Chinese consumer
"expenditure, and Gratification’s association with High Street retail preference means"
that physical retail remains the dominant channel for delivering experiential and
seductive interactions. Retailers should focus on the shopping experience as a stress-
"reducing experience alongside seasonal trend communication. Therefore, incorporating"
experiential store features such as luxury coffee bars into stores in China would
capitalise upon pre-existing social motivations while being sympathetic to the
idiosyncratic nature of luxury fashion branding.

Limitations And Future Studies
0
"This paper is limited in its focus on physical (gender, age and shopping environment)"
and motivational influences rather than psychological or attitudinal attributes. Future
studies may consider investigating psychological and attitudinal elements of Chinese
fashion retail to offer a deeper understanding of why the parameters of this paper
influence shopping motivations. The degree to which variables including shopping
motivations translates to purchase behaviours requires more research in the fashion
context to increase the strategic targeting of marketing campaigns. Future studies shall
need a larger sample than this paper to distinguish small yet significant effect sizes
"without the risk of Type II errors. Finally, a qualitative investigation can open doors for"
a deeper understanding of psychological factors influencing motivation as reported in
this paper.
